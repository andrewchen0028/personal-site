          <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.skydio.com">Skydio</a> is the premier U.S.
          drone manufacturer and creates the most advanced autonomous drones in the world.
          I
          added two modules to Skydio's internal simulation stack, which is used for testing software before hardware
          integration. Both modules were written in Python and C++.
        </p>
        <ul id="skydio-details">
          <li id="skydio-collisions">
            <p>
              The first module adds collision physics for simulated objects. We wanted this functionality to be able
              to
              test scenarios with the vehicle taking off from and landing on raised platforms. This module involed
              algebraic operations on signed distance functions, as described on <a target="_blank"
                rel="noopener noreferrer"
                href="https://www.iquilezles.org/www/articles/distfunctions/distfunctions.htm">Inigo Quilez's
                site</a>.
              The collision force vector itself was modeled using simple mass-spring damper dynamics.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li id="skydio-drift">
            <p>
              The second module enables simulation of sensor drift in flight. Skydio drones use a suite of six cameras
              for <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_odometry#Visual_inertial_odometry">visual-inertial
                odometry</a>, which becomes prone to sensor drift when factors such as high altitude or rapid motion
              degrade the accuracy of the vehicle pose estimate. My module allows for granular spoofing of sensor
              drift
              in the simulator: the user can choose any combination of pseudorandom or user-supplied drift vectors,
              and
              set drift sensitivity to each of the factors which influence drift severity in real life.

          I created parallelized anomaly detection tools for Sierra Nevada's Dream Chaser spacecraft. These tools were
          written in MATLAB to scan over 50GB of data from Monte Carlo simulations and hardware-in-loop telemetry,
          with user-configurable thresholds on error magnitude and duration to identify anomalous data.

          I took on various hardware tasks at the LaRC machine shop and makerspace, including 3D printing, CNC, and CAD.
          My primary project was creating prototypes for the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
            href="https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/spacetech/small_spacecraft/ACS3">Advanced Composite Solar Sail
            System</a>, a 12U CubeSat designed to test a solar sail using a novel carbon-fiber boom configuration.

          During this time I also co-lead my high school's team in the first NASA App Development Challenge. Our team
          won out of over thirty teams in the country, by developing a real-time telementry visualizer for the Orion
          Ascent Abort-2 mission. This visualizer took over 25,000 quaternion data points from Orion's flight data
          recorders and returned a video playback of the flight.

          A rocket I designed and component-tested in high school for the Team America Rocketry Challenge. The objective of this competition was to match a target apogee and flight time, and at the time the competition was capped by luck via the variance inherent in hobbyist solid rocket motors. My goal with this design was to create an electromechanical parachute deployment and reefing mechanism, which coupled with a compact altimeter would allow us to hit the target apogee and flight time perfectly on every attempt. I graduated before this rocket could be fully deployed.
